Study of the effects of sleep deprivation on metacognition

## Mathematical details
Following Bürkner and Vourre (2019) we implement a cumulative model to analyse the results.

## Files
- `Analysis.py`: The Python module containing the code necessary to run the analysis.
- `analysis_script.py`: The script that runs the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: All Python modules outside the Standard Library that are required by code in this directory. To install the modules, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Directories
- `Data`: This directory must exist, and contains the data to be analysed.
- `Documentation`: This directory contains a more detailed description of the mathematical details of the analysis.
